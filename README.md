XCPData: Real Paired X-ray and CT Dataset for 3D Reconstruction and Clinical Analysis

XCPData is a real-world paired X-ray and CT dataset curated specifically for research on X-ray to CT 3D reconstruction and clinical imaging tasks. It provides high-quality, real paired data to support cross-modal learning, anatomical understanding, and clinically relevant applications such as fracture detection and surgical planning.

📦 Dataset Overview

- Total cases: 48
- Modalities: Real X-ray images paired with corresponding CT volumes
- Anatomical regions:
  - Chest: 41 cases
  - Hip: 2 cases
  - Knee: 1 case
  - Head: 4 cases
- Clinical scenarios: Includes cases with fractures and other pathological findings
- Format: NIfTI (CT), PNG (X-ray)

🔬 Motivation

Traditional datasets often rely on digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) generated from CT scans to simulate X-ray images. However, these DRRs fail to accurately capture the noise characteristics and scatter effects present in real X-rays, leading to domain gaps that can negatively affect model performance.

XCPData addresses this issue by providing real paired X-ray and CT images, enabling more robust training and evaluation for cross-modal reconstruction and segmentation.

🎯 Key Applications

- X-ray to CT 3D reconstruction
- Cross-modal medical image translation
- Fracture detection and segmentation
- Clinical decision support tools
- Evaluation of DRR vs. real X-ray domain shift
